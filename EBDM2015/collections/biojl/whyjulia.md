# Ok... but why?

- Came about to tackle the two-language problem.

- I love programming and different tools and languages... but!

- The two language problem hinders science.

- It prevents us "treating code right".

- Too many languages for the non-code-savvy scientist.

- Time spent mastering the n'th language is time not thinking about subject.

- Mixing and combining languages is even more troublesome!

- What does this mean when it comes to review?

- And what about packages, publication = one review?
